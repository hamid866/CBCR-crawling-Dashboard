Letter from the Chairman of the
Board of Managing Directors
Frankfurt/Main, March 2022
With Russia's attack on Ukraine, the geopolitical and economic structure of the world, as we had known it
up to then, has been shaken. Until a few weeks ago, no one had really imagined that a state could break a
blanket war against a neighbour on European soil. And no one is able to say exactly what the European and
global order will look like. The struggle between democracy and autocracy could become the defining
conflict of the 21st Century. What human suffering can be associated with this, the images from Ukraine
have impressively shown us. We feel with the people who have been drawn to this war, although the full
extent of their suffering can only be guessed. It is difficult to look back on the 2021 financial year in view of
this dramatic development, the short- and long-term effects of which cannot be estimated at the moment.
The attack on Ukraine relativizes so much, including the Corona pandemic. I'm still trying:
2021 was the first year of the comprehensive transformation of Commerzbank, which we initiated on the
Board of Management with our "Strategy 2024". It was a demanding, very intense year. And, regardless of
the odds, it was a good and successful year for Commerzbank. We have moved a lot and achieved a lot.
Our goal is clear: we aim to make Commerzbank THE digital advisory bank for Germany – customer-
oriented, digital, sustainable and also suitably profitable again. We are making progress towards this goal
that is visible to everyone. We achieved a consolidated profit in the 2021 financial year despite special
charges totalling around €2bn, mainly relating to the restructuring and foreign currency loans at our Polish
subsidiary mBank. We owe our ability to shoulder these considerable burdens while keeping our CET1
capital ratio high and staying in the black to significantly lower loan loss provisions and, in particular, to
very robust customer business. We also showed the necessary discipline when it came to costs.
The new Commerzbank delivers what it promises! That is the central message we wish to convey while
reviewing the past year. We are increasingly transitioning into delivery mode. The encouraging key figures
are only one aspect of this success. What is almost more important is that the restructuring of
Commerzbank is making real progress. We are realigning our business model based on the needs of our
customers, streamlining our organisation, simplifying structures and modernising processes. Not
everything works right away, there are setbacks and occasional changes of plan along the way –
unavoidable in a transformation of this scale. But the vast majority of initiatives are right on track, and we
have reached the key milestones set for the first year of the restructuring.
For example, the gross reduction of 10,000 jobs that is necessary for the planned cost decrease of
around 20% by 2024 – carried out so as to be as socially responsible as possible – is well under way. We
agreed a framework reconciliation of interests and a framework social plan with the employeeTo our Shareholders Corporate Responsibility Management Report Risk Report Financial Statements Further Information 3

representatives in May. A voluntary severance programme then started in July, and we were able to finalise
the partial reconciliations of interests for the respective divisions by November. This means that only nine
months elapsed between the adoption of the strategy and the final negotiations on the target structure. The
fact that it happened so quickly was mainly due to the very constructive and trust-based talks between the
social partners. As of today, well over half of the gross job reductions (about 6,000 full-time equivalents)
have already been realised through corresponding agreements with employees. On this basis, we are
certain that we will achieve our goal.
This also applies to the optimisation of our branch network, another cornerstone of our strategy. In
Germany, we reduced the number of branches from around 800 to about 550 as at the end of 2021; thus,
most of the road on the way to the target of 450 branches has already been traversed. Before the
coronavirus pandemic we still had 1,000 branches. We are also making faster-than-expected progress in
streamlining our international network. During the year, we shut 6 of the total of 15 locations scheduled for
closure. Add to this the sale of our Hungarian subsidiary to Erste Bank Hungary, which was agreed shortly
before the end of the year. Thanks to the cooperation agreement concluded at the same time with Erste
Bank Group, we will actually be able to expand our range of services in the region for our corporate
customers in the future. In addition, we have already completed the dismantling of our agency network in
Switzerland and are now concentrating on the Zurich location. We are increasingly relying on partnership
models in other areas, too. In May we announced the streamlining of our capital markets business through
extensive collaboration in equity trading and equity research with ODDO BHF. Partnerships exemplify
much of what we are doing right now: enhancing efficiency while consistently focusing on the needs of our
core customers, reducing costs and complexity without compromising on customer service.
But it would be far too short-sighted to reduce our strategy to downsizing, outsourcing and exit. There is
much more at stake: a new, future-proof business model.
In the private customer business, we have made important progress on the journey to becoming a digital
advisory bank for Germany. The first three locations of the future advisory centre have begun operations.
They are already looking after around 850,000 customers. We have so far been effective in limiting
customer churn due to branch closures. We have achieved this retention thanks to excellent service, a high
level of advisory expertise and the expansion of our digital services. It remains to be seen whether we will
accomplish that in the current year. In any case, we will fight hard for it.
As in the Private and Small-Business Customers segment, the transformation is also well under way in
the corporate customer business. Here we are building on our excellent market position among German
small and medium-sized enterprises. We are also establishing new services on the way to becoming a more
digital, innovative corporate customer bank. Examples of this are the first live transactions via the Marco
Polo trade finance network with an irrevocable blockchain-based promise to pay, as well as the introduction
of digital signatures. The successful piloting of our “Mittelstandsbank Direkt” service is also noteworthy.
Many of our customers are already using it. In the corporate customer business, priorities that are very high
on our agenda include not only an ongoing improvement of our services and greater digitalisation, but also
increasing capital efficiency. During the year, we reduced the proportion of business involving insufficiently
profitable use of risk-weighted assets faster than planned. That is a pleasing result, but it is not the end of
our ambition.
For private and corporate customers alike, the more emphatic orientation of our business towards
sustainability criteria is of decisive importance for the future. In September we set ourselves ambitious
goals. We intend for our loan and investment portfolio to reach net zero carbon emissions no later than
2050, and our own banking operations by 2040 at the latest. We are aiming for a volume of sustainable
business at around €300bn by 2025; at the end of 2021 it was already €194bn. As a bank, we are financiers
of the green transformation. We aim to help channel more capital into sustainable economic activities in
order to mitigate the consequences of climate change. And we want to actively support our customers in
their own transformation into sustainable companies. Sustainability is thus becoming a mainstay of our
business model.
Dear shareholders, 2021 was a year of new beginnings for Commerzbank, which gives us cause for
optimism. Because we have begun the transformation with real drive and our success is increasingly being
recognised. Because we see that our strategy is working and the transformation is making good progress.4 Commerzbank Annual Report 2021
Because the key figures point in the right direction. And not least because we receive a great deal of
positive feedback from our customers, who are loyal to Commerzbank and value our services. That is all the
result of hard work. On behalf of the entire Board of Managing Directors, I would like to thank the
management team and all our employees for this.
It will remain important in the future that we at Commerzbank work together with all our might to
pursue our objectives and fight for sustainable success, because we are, of course, still a long way from
reaching our goal. The restructuring must continue. Digitalisation must continue to gain momentum and
create value. The income side of the business needs to be strengthened, even in the midst of a pandemic.
These are challenging tasks that will demand a lot from us. We have put in place what was achievable in the
short term. In order to deliver what we have promised for 2024, we will have to stretch even further than
before.
2022 is therefore an important, maybe even the decisive year for our transformation. In line with our
strategic planning, we will launch or continue to drive forward a large number of initiatives in all divisions
of the Bank. One of the most important of these will be the Germany-wide rollout of the advisory centre for
our private customers. In the corporate customer business, the focus will be on further technology-driven
innovations in conjunction with customers and partners and on the implementation of a cost-efficient,
sophisticated model for customer relationship management. In addition, we will advance further in
optimising our international positioning and invest a lot of energy in translating the sustainability strategy
into reality.
Across all areas, it is essential to maintain success in the customer business. However, we will not let up
on the cost side either. If we can achieve both, we can take another big step forward this year – although we
have not yet been able to take into account the effects of the war and economic sanctions against Russia in
our planning. Our exposure there was significantly influenced by the support of German companies on the
Russian market. It is manageable and has already been significantly reduced in the past.
Regardless of the current uncertainty, we are therefore sticking to our previous plans: We are aiming for
an increase in net profit to more than €1bn in the current year. And if we achieve this, we want to start
dividend payments again for the 2022 financial year, with a payout ratio that should be at 30%. This should
be the start of the return to our shareholders of more capital than previously planned. In total, we aim to
distribute between €3bn and €5bn through dividends and share buybacks until the 2024 financial year.
We also raised our medium-term targets slightly in view of the great progress in our transformation,
rising interest rates in Poland and strong customer business. We now expect an operating profit of €3bn in
2024 and a return on equity of more than 7%.
We all know that this will not be enough in the long term to remain a dominant force in the market. So, we
need to be ready for further change and think beyond the time horizon of our current strategy. We will start in
2022.
We are convinced that it is worthwhile to accompany Commerzbank on its way, even in these troubled
times. I would be delighted to welcome you at our virtual Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2022.

Report of the Supervisory Board
Frankfurt/Main, March 2022
Commerzbank tackled a range of challenges in the 2021 financial year and initiated a far-reaching
transformation with its “Strategy 2024” programme. The Supervisory Board advised the Board of Managing
Directors on its conduct of the Bank’s affairs and supervised and monitored the way in which Commerzbank
was managed. The Board of Managing Directors reported to the Supervisory Board promptly, extensively and
at regular intervals on all the major developments at the Bank, including in the periods between meetings.
The Supervisory Board received frequent and regular information on the Bank’s business position and
economic situation, particularly against the backdrop of the coronavirus crisis, and on considerations relating
to the Bank’s strategic realignment, its corporate planning, the sustainability strategy, the performance of the
share price, compliance issues, loan loss provisions and the Bank’s risk strategy, and advised the Board of
Managing Directors on these topics. The Supervisory Board and its committees held a total of 49 meetings in
the past financial year. Between meetings, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board was also continually in
touch with the Chairman and other members of the Board of Managing Directors according to a set timetable
and kept up to date with the current business progress, strategic considerations, the risk situation, risk
management, compliance issues and major business transactions within both the Bank and the Group.
The Supervisory Board was involved in decisions of major importance for the Bank, giving its approval
after extensive consultation and examination wherever required.
Meetings of the Supervisory Board
A total of 12 Supervisory Board meetings were held during the financial year. In preparation for these
meetings, the shareholder representatives and employee representatives regularly held separate preparatory
meetings. The Supervisory Board’s work focused in particular on supporting the initial and further
development of the strategy and on monitoring its implementation. The Supervisory Board was kept fully
informed by the Board of Managing Directors about the development of the new strategy and was involved in
an advisory capacity. The Supervisory Board subsequently received reports on the status of strategy
implementation and the Bank’s strategic transformation on an ongoing basis. The Supervisory Board was alsoTo our Shareholders Corporate Responsibility Management Report Risk Report Financial Statements Further Information 7

kept informed about the further development of the strategy and advised the Board of Managing Directors on
this. Commerzbank’s sustainability strategy was likewise discussed in detail. The Supervisory Board and the
Board of Managing Directors examined the Bank’s strategic direction in depth in two strategy meetings in
2021; the shareholder representatives and employee representatives held additional preparatory meetings
with the Board of Managing Directors for the same purpose.
The Supervisory Board also focused intensively on personnel issues in 2021, in particular the appointment
of two new members of the Board of Managing Directors and successors to the Chairman and four further
members of the Supervisory Board.
Another focus of the Supervisory Board’s work in 2021 was the further development of the structure of the
Board of Managing Directors and its remuneration system, in particular with regard to variable remuneration.
Finally, the Supervisory Board once again addressed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the Bank in
2021 and continued to monitor the Bank’s financial and business performance and risk situation more closely.
The focus of all ordinary meetings was the Bank’s current business position, which the Supervisory Board
discussed in detail with the Board of Managing Directors. The Supervisory Board considered in depth the
financial and business performance of the Bank and its business segments, the risk situation, the strategy and
its implementation status along with the strategic transformation referred to above, planning, compliance and
tax issues, regulatory audits, the risk management system and the internal control system. The Supervisory
Board regularly discussed a range of issues where the Board of Managing Directors was not present.
It subjected the reports of the Board of Managing Directors to analysis, in some cases requesting
supplementary information, which was always provided. The Supervisory Board also received information on
internal and official investigations into the Bank in Germany and other countries and asked questions
regarding these prior to formulating an opinion.
The Supervisory Board conducted its business in two different ways in 2021. Due to coronavirus
restrictions, the meetings were mainly held as hybrid events, with some Supervisory Board members
attending in person and some virtually via video. In-person meetings were held where possible.
Where the Supervisory Board deemed it necessary, it brought in consultants to assist it in its activities.
The following specific topics were discussed at the Supervisory Board meetings:
At the extraordinary meeting on 3 February 2021, the Board of Managing Directors presented Commerzbank’s
“Strategy 2024” programme to the Supervisory Board, with the two boards then discussing it in detail.
At the meeting on 10 February 2021, the Board of Managing Directors reported in detail on the current
business situation, the preliminary results for the 2020 financial year, outsourcing and data protection at
Commerzbank and compliance issues. The Supervisory Board discussed and resolved the variable
remuneration of the members of the Board of Managing Directors for the 2020 financial year. It also
addressed the risk strategies, the cyber and information security strategy and the impact of the coronavirus
pandemic on the Bank. In addition, the Supervisory Board addressed the Supervisory Board report and the
declaration on corporate governance.
On 16 March 2021, the members of the Supervisory Board were informed that Hans-Jörg Vetter would be
resigning his position as Chairman and member of the Supervisory Board of Commerzbank AG for health
reasons at the close of 16 March 2021. The shareholder representatives discussed the process for appointing
a successor.
At the accounts review meeting on 18 March 2021, the Supervisory Board reviewed the 2020 financial
statements for the parent company and the Group and approved them on the Audit Committee’s
recommendation. It approved the proposed resolutions for the agenda of the 2021 Annual General Meeting8 Commerzbank Annual Report 2021
and the proposal to hold the 2021 Annual General Meeting as a virtual Annual General Meeting. The Board of
Managing Directors reported to the Supervisory Board on the current business situation, the status of
implementation of the “Strategy 2024” programme, the overall risk strategy, developments in connection with
mBank’s Swiss franc loan portfolio, compliance issues and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The
Supervisory Board addressed the review of possible breaches of duty by members of the Board of Managing
Directors in connection with the credit exposure to the Wirecard Group and the settlement with the FCA
regarding systems to prevent money laundering. The Supervisory Board also considered and approved the
targets for the members of the Board of Managing Directors for the 2021 financial year and reviewed the
performance of former members of the Board of Managing Directors with regard to the long-term incentive
component of variable remuneration for the 2015 performance year by means of a retrospective performance
evaluation. It also discussed the remuneration report and the 2020 combined separate non-financial report.
The results of the evaluation and self-assessment of the Supervisory Board for the 2020 financial year, which
were carried out internally within the Bank, were presented and discussed. The Supervisory Board was also
consulted on the appointment of the new Remuneration Officer and his deputy. Finally, the Supervisory Board
was informed about the status of the search for a new member of the Supervisory Board.
At the extraordinary meeting on 24 March 2021, the Supervisory Board considered the proposal for the
election of a new member of the Supervisory Board to be put to the 2021 Annual General Meeting. At the
meeting, Andreas Schmitz announced that he was resigning from the Commerzbank Supervisory Board with
immediate effect.
On 28 March 2021, the Supervisory Board resolved at an extraordinary meeting to propose to the 2021
Annual General Meeting that Helmut Gottschalk be elected to the Supervisory Board as shareholder
representative and successor to Hans-Jörg Vetter. Prior to the meeting, the Supervisory Board determined
both the individual suitability of Helmut Gottschalk and the collective suitability of the Supervisory Board with
Helmut Gottschalk as Hans-Jörg Vetter’s successor.
At the end of March, Dr. Victoria Ossadnik, Dr. Tobias Guldimann and Dr. Rainer Hillebrand announced
their intention to resign from the Supervisory Board of Commerzbank with effect from the end of the 2021
Annual General Meeting.
At a further extraordinary meeting in April 2021, the Supervisory Board resolved to propose to the 2021
Annual General Meeting that, in addition to Helmut Gottschalk, Daniela Mattheus, Caroline Seifert, Burkhard
Keese and Frank Westhoff also be elected to the Supervisory Board as shareholder representatives and
successors to Dr. Victoria Ossadnik, Dr. Tobias Guldimann, Dr. Rainer Hillebrand and Andreas Schmitz. Prior
to the meeting, the Supervisory Board determined both the individual suitability of the named candidates and
the collective suitability of the Supervisory Board with their inclusion as successors to the departing members
of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board also resolved to ask the Board of Managing Directors to
apply for Helmut Gottschalk to be appointed by a court as a member of the Supervisory Board until the end of
the Annual General Meeting which decides on the discharge of liability for the 2020 financial year. Finally,
the Supervisory Board elected Dr. Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell to the Presiding and Nomination Committee.
At an extraordinary meeting on 29 April 2021, Helmut Gottschalk, who had by then been appointed by a
court as a member of the Supervisory Board, was elected as Chairman of the Supervisory Board until the end
of the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The Supervisory Board also resolved to engage a law firm to review
possible breaches of duty by members of the Board of Managing Directors in connection with the credit
exposure to the Wirecard Group.To our Shareholders Corporate Responsibility Management Report Risk Report Financial Statements Further Information 9

Following the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2021, which elected Helmut Gottschalk to the
Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board held a further extraordinary meeting at which it elected Helmut
Gottschalk as Chairman of the Supervisory Board for the duration of his term of office as a member of the
Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board also resolved to amend its rules of procedure and appointed the
shareholder representatives newly elected by the 2021 Annual General Meeting to the Supervisory Board
committees. The Board of Managing Directors reported to the Supervisory Board on the current business
situation, in particular the results for the first quarter, and on the results of the negotiations with the
employee representative committees regarding the “Strategy 2024” programme.
At the meeting on 16 June 2021, the Board of Managing Directors reported on the current business
situation, the status of the implementation of the “Strategy 2024” programme, and the operationalisation of
the multi-year plan and the business strategy. The Bank’s sustainability agenda was presented to the
Supervisory Board, which discussed it in detail with the Board of Managing Directors. The results of the
review by an external law firm of possible breaches of duty by members of the Board of Managing Directors
in connection with the credit exposure to the Wirecard Group were presented to and discussed with the
Supervisory Board. Both the external legal opinion and the internal reviews concluded that there was no
breach of the duty of care on the part of the Board of Managing Directors. The Supervisory Board also
addressed the further development of the structure of the Board of Managing Directors. The position of
Deputy Chairperson of the Board of Managing Directors was newly created, with the corresponding new
remuneration conditions added to the remuneration system subject to the submission of the new system for
approval by the Annual General Meeting. Dr. Bettina Orlopp was appointed Deputy Chairperson of the Board
of Managing Directors, and her term of office was renewed. The Supervisory Board also resolved to extend
Jörg Hessenmüller’s appointment to the Board of Managing Directors. The Supervisory Board defined one
key audit matter for 2021 and appointed Ernst&Young GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft,
Eschborn/Frankfurt am Main, to audit the combined separate non-financial report for Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft and the Group as at 31 December 2021. Finally, the Supervisory Board was informed about
the new regulations laid down in the German Financial Market Integrity Strengthening Act and the status of
their implementation.
At the meeting on 15 September 2021, the Board of Managing Directors reported on the Bank’s business
situation, in particular the results for the second quarter, and on the progress of the transformation. The
Board of Managing Directors also discussed the developments regarding the intended outsourcing of
securities settlement business (the Sirius project), the reasons for discontinuing the project and the next steps.
The law firm engaged to carry out the responsibility review in relation to the Sirius project and the Internal
Audit department then presented their findings and discussed them with the Supervisory Board. The
Supervisory Board resolved to terminate the appointment of Jörg Hessenmüller and his employment contract
by mutual consent by concluding a termination agreement. Subject to approval by the regulatory authority,
Dr. Jörg Oliveri del Castillo-Schulz was appointed as his successor on the Board of Managing Directors. In
addition, Thomas Schaufler was appointed as member of the Board of Managing Directors responsible for
Private and Small-Business Customers, also subject to approval by the regulatory authority. The Supervisory
Board discussed the challenges facing Commerzbank with representatives of the senior management of the
European Central Bank’s Single Supervisory Mechanism and exchanged views with them on various topics.
The Supervisory Board also defined further key audit matters for 2021 and resolved new model contracts for
appointments to the Board of Managing Directors and for pension arrangements.
The main focus of the meeting on 30 September 2021 was the discussion of the strategic business
objectives presented by the Board of Managing Directors. The Supervisory Board held in-depth discussions on
strategic issues, the profitability of products and customers, and the structure of the Bank’s balance sheet with10 Commerzbank Annual Report 2021
the Board of Managing Directors and made suggestions on these topics. The Supervisory Board also redefined
the tasks of the Digitalisation and Technology Committee and changed its name to the Digital Transformation
Committee. In addition, the Supervisory Board resolved further amendments to its rules of procedure.
At the last meeting of the year on 24 November 2021, the planning for the period up until 2025 and the
risk and outsourcing strategy were presented to the Supervisory Board, which it acknowledged after detailed
discussion. The Board of Managing Directors reported on the business situation, including the results for the
third quarter, balance sheet structure management, the partial reconciliations of interests negotiated with the
employee representative committees, and various compliance and tax issues. The latest developments in the
coronavirus pandemic and their impact on the Bank were also presented to the Supervisory Board along with
the status of the Bank’s transformation. In addition, the Supervisory Board was informed about the structure
and appropriateness of Commerzbank’s remuneration systems and reviewed the appropriateness of the
remuneration of the Board of Managing Directors. The Supervisory Board addressed the further development
of the system governing the variable remuneration of the Board of Managing Directors and defined the 2022
targets for the members of the Board of Managing Directors. Finally, the Supervisory Board reviewed the
performance of former members of the Board of Managing Directors with regard to the long-term incentive
component of variable remuneration for the 2016 performance year by means of a retrospective performance
evaluation. Other topics covered at this meeting included the Bank’s corporate governance; in particular, the
Supervisory Board approved the annual declaration of compliance with the German Corporate Governance
Code pursuant to Art. 161 of the German Stock Corporation Act, reviewed the independence of the members
of the Supervisory Board, set targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board, and resolved diversity
policies for the composition of the Board of Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board. More details on
corporate governance at Commerzbank can be found on pages 27 to 33 of this Annual Report. The
Supervisory Board discussed the further development of ESG expertise within the Supervisory Board to keep
pace with developments at Commerzbank in relation to sustainability and respond adequately to the growing
requirements and duties of the Supervisory Board in this area. The Supervisory Board also considered the future
structure of the 2021 remuneration report and resolved to engage the auditor to check the accuracy of the

Committees
To ensure that it can perform its duties efficiently, the Supervisory Board has formed seven permanent
committees from its members.
The current composition of the committees is shown on page 19 of this Annual Report. The duties and
responsibilities of the individual committees are defined in the Supervisory Board’s rules of procedure, which
can be found online at https://www.commerzbank.com.

The committee received explanations from the auditor about the results of the audit of the financial
statements of Commerzbank’s parent company and the Group and the accompanying auditor’s reports. It also
received regular reports from the auditor on the current status and individual results of the annual audit of
the financial statements and of the audit of the combined separate non-financial report, as well as the results
of the reviews of the interim reports, separate financial information and interim financial information.
Discussions in the committee centred on the focus areas for the audit and the key audit matters identified by
the auditor. To safeguard the economic independence of the auditor, the Audit Committee obtained and
discussed the auditor’s declaration of independence pursuant to Art. 6 of the EU Audit Regulation. The
committee also dealt with requests for the auditor to perform non-audit services and received a report on this
from the Group Finance department responsible for monitoring. The committee also discussed the quality of
the audit, both internally and in consultation with the auditor. Based on these discussions, the Audit
Committee submitted proposals to the Supervisory Board regarding the appointment of the auditor, the
amount of the auditor’s fees and the key audit matters, and the appointment of an auditor for the combined
separate non-financial report.
On the basis of the selection process carried out in accordance with Art. 16 of Regulation (EU) No
537/2014, the Audit Committee recommended that the Supervisory Board propose to the Annual General
Meeting that either KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin, or PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, be appointed as auditor and Group auditor and as
auditor for the review of interim financial reports. As a first step, the 2021 Annual General Meeting appointed
KPMG AG, the preferred choice, as auditor for the review of any additional interim financial information for
periods after 31 December 2021 and before the 2022 Annual General Meeting. It will then be proposed to the
2022 Annual General Meeting that said audit firm also be appointed as the new auditor and Group auditor for
the entire 2022 financial year. The committee was informed in detail about the process and status of the
handover of audit activities from the current auditor, Ernst&Young (EY), to the future auditor, KPMG.
The committee also discussed the work of the Bank’s Group Audit and Group Compliance units in detail.
Both presented regular (at least quarterly) reports on the results of their work, measures to optimise it and
the planning of their future activities, and presented their annual reports to the committee. In particular, the
Audit Committee received regular reports on the results of various internal and external reviews of
compliance with the local regulations that have to be observed by Commerzbank’s branches and subsidiaries
worldwide. The committee also obtained an overview of the status of efforts to remedy any deficiencies
identified in this area by means of regular (at least quarterly) reports from the business units concerned and
from Group Audit and Group Compliance. At two meetings, the committee discussed the further development
of KYC processes in detail together with the Board of Managing Directors and the auditor. At two meetings,
the committee also addressed the Wirecard matter in detail in respect of compliance with internal and
external requirements. In addition, the committee had Group Tax explain the current status and measures for
the further development of tax compliance.
The committee reviewed the effectiveness of the Bank’s risk management system and of its internal
control system in particular. This review was based on reports from a range of sources including the auditor,
Group Risk Management and Group Audit. The committee also acknowledged the auditor’s report on the
review of reporting obligations and rules of conduct under the German Securities Trading Act.
In addition to the six meetings described above, the Audit Committee held an extraordinary meeting
following the Annual General Meeting. At this meeting, Burkhard Keese was appointed as the new Chairman
of the Audit Committee. He replaced Dr. Tobias Guldimann, who had stepped down from the Supervisory
Board.
The Risk Committee held five ordinary and four extraordinary meetings in the past financial year. At these
meetings, it dealt intensively with the Bank’s risk situation and risk management, particularly against the
backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic. The main topics discussed in this regard were the impact of the12 Commerzbank Annual Report 2021
economic crisis triggered by the pandemic on Commerzbank’s loan portfolio, its loan loss provisions and risk
result, and its capital ratios. Other important topics included the risks for Commerzbank arising from mBank’s
Swiss franc loan portfolio, the Wirecard scandal and the approach to and management of country risks. The
Risk Committee also examined the overall risk strategy for 2021, the sub-risk strategies for 2021 and credit,
market, liquidity, counterparty and operational risks. It also discussed reputational, compliance, cyber and
regulatory risks. In addition, the Risk Committee dealt extensively with ESG risks. Significant individual
exposures of the Bank were also discussed in detail with the Board of Managing Directors, as were portfolios
and sub-portfolios. The Risk Committee also considered major corporate transactions and the development of
equity holdings. Furthermore, it was informed about the Bank’s recovery plan and approved changes in the
thresholds of certain recovery plan indicators. The Risk Committee also reviewed whether terms and
conditions in customer business are compatible with the Bank’s business model and risk structure, and
discussed various stress tests and their results. The meetings included consideration of the employee
remuneration system and the audits and risk assessment of Commerzbank by its regulators. The Risk
Committee also examined Commerzbank’s risk-bearing capacity, major loans to Commerzbank Group
companies, loans to officers at those parties and high-risk exposures.
At the meeting on 27 January 2021, Andreas Schmitz was elected as Chairman of the Risk Committee. He
succeeded Nicholas Teller, who had stepped down from the Supervisory Board. Following the resignation of
Andreas Schmitz, Dr. Rainer Hillebrand was initially elected as Chairman of the Risk Committee. Following
the Annual General Meeting, the members of the Risk Committee elected Frank Westhoff as Chairman of the
Risk Committee.

it deemed it necessary, sought support from external recruitment consultants. It also examined the individual
and collective suitability of the new candidates and the board as a whole, taking into account the relevant
skills and expertise profiles and suitability matrices, and made corresponding recommendations for
resolutions to the plenary Supervisory Board. The Presiding and Nomination Committee addressed the review

Compensation Control Committee met five times. It assisted the Supervisory Board in setting the targets for
the members of the Board of Managing Directors for the 2021 financial year and made corresponding
recommendations for resolutions. The committee considered the target achievement of the Board of
Managing Directors for 2020 and reviewed the setting of the total amount of variable remuneration for

evaluation and submitted corresponding resolution recommendations to the full Supervisory Board.
The committee also addressed the further development of the structure of the Board of Managing

Change of auditor
On 12 October 2020, Commerzbank published the procedure for selecting a new auditor for Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft and Group auditor for the Commerzbank Group for the 2022 financial year in the Federal
Gazette [Bundesanzeiger]. The operational management of the selection process was carried out by an
internal project team appointed by the Audit Committee. The definition of the key stages in the process, the
selection criteria and the key decisions were discussed in advance with the Chairman of the Audit Committee
and approved by the Audit Committee. At its meetings, the Audit Committee received regular reports on the
progress of the procedure and discussed and decided on the next key steps. The project team included
representatives from Group Finance and Group Legal under the overall responsibility of the Divisional Board
member for Group Finance. The project team liaised with the Chairman of the Audit Committee on a regular
basis. In accordance with EU rules on public tenders, the entire process was conducted in a fair, transparent
and non-discriminatory manner. Through the announcement of the tender in the Federal Gazette, auditing
firms were initially invited to express their interest in participating in the selection process. Interested parties
were then provided with extensive documentation to enable them to submit a detailed written bid. All
potential bidders were also given the opportunity to clarify any unanswered questions in a question and
answer session. The written bids subsequently submitted were analysed and evaluated by an evaluation team
consisting of the Chief Financial Officer, Divisional Board members and senior representatives from all the
principally affected divisions. Applicants were also invited to present their bid and key team members in
person. These presentations were attended by the Chairman of the Audit Committee and representatives of
the evaluation team. The key economic points of the bid were also discussed with the applicants. At the end
of the tender procedure, a detailed report on the procedure and the assessment of the applicants was
submitted to the Audit Committee for validation. On the basis of this report, the Audit Committee formed its
opinion and recommended to the Supervisory Board that either KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft,
Berlin, or PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, be proposed
to the Annual General Meeting as the new auditor and Group auditor for the 2022 financial year. The
committee also indicated its own preference for KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin. The
Supervisory Board decided to follow the recommendation and preference of the Audit Committee. In line with
the recommendation of the Supervisory Board, the 2021 Annual General Meeting initially appointed KPMG
AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, Berlin, as the new auditor for the review of interim financial information,
if any, for the quarters of the 2022 financial year up to the 2022 Annual General Meeting. In respect of the
proposal for the appointment of the auditor and Group auditor for the 2022 financial year, both the AuditTo our Shareholders Corporate Responsibility Management Report Risk Report Financial Statements Further Information 15

Committee and the Supervisory Board stand by their recommendation and preference. The Supervisory Board
will therefore propose to the 2022 Annual General Meeting that KPMG AG Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft,
Berlin, be appointed as the auditor and Group auditor for the 2022 financial year and as the auditor for the
review of the condensed financial statements and interim management report pursuant to Art. 115 (5) and Art.
117 no. 2 of the German Securities Trading Act (WpHG) as at 30 June 2022 and any additional interim
financial information pursuant to Art. 115 (7) WpHG and Art. 340i (4) of the German Commercial Code (HGB)

after 31 December 2022 and before the 2023 Annual General Meeting.
Conflicts of interest
In accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code and Art. 3 (6) of the rules of procedure of the
Supervisory Board, members of Commerzbank’s Supervisory Board are required to disclose conflicts of
interest without delay to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or the Chairman’s deputy, who will in turn
consult with the Presiding and Nomination Committee and disclose the conflict of interest to the Supervisory
Board. No member of the Supervisory Board declared a conflict of interest during the year under review.
Training and development measures
The members of the Supervisory Board undertook the training and development measures required for their
duties at their own initiative, with appropriate support from Commerzbank. Further training and development
took place on a regular basis. The following workshops were held in 2021: “Balance sheet modelling from an
interest and liquidity perspective”, “Cyber risk” and “Compliance/Anti-Money Laundering Act”. The Financial
Market Integrity Strengthening Act and its implementation in the Bank were also presented to the full
Supervisory Board. The Digital Transformation Committee discussed DORA, BAIT and digital assets in detail.
An internal training session on the new EBA criteria for identifying risk bearers was also conducted during a
meeting of the Compensation Control Committee. In addition, members of the Supervisory Board attended
internal and external training courses on topics such as sustainability and corporate governance.
As a result of the changes on the Supervisory Board, onboarding events were held in 2021 for the new
members of the Supervisory Board. In addition, the new Supervisory Board members were offered
individually tailored internal training and induction measures. Divisions such as Risk and Compliance
provided individual Supervisory Board members with in-depth insight into their activities and organisation.
Participation in meetings
The following table shows the number of meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees attended by
each individual member in the 2021 financial year. If Supervisory Board members were unable to attend a

1 The termination benefits in the 2021 financial year concern Jörg Hessenmüller. They concerned Martin Zielke, Roland Boekhout
and Michael Mandel in the previous year.
2 The remuneration system also gives rise to pro-rata recognition of share-based remuneration in respect of future financial years.
This has the effect of increasing expenses for new members of the Board of Managing Directors in particular, since no pro-rata
remuneration was recorded for them in previous years. In the 2020 financial year, corrections had to be made related to expenses
recognised in previous years due to the unscheduled terminations.
3 Under the current remuneration system, the grant does not take place until the entitlements have arisen, which in 2021 led to a
year-on-year increase in total remuneration under Art. 314 (1) no. 6 (a) sentence 1 of the German Commercial Code, in particular
as the latter contains the long-term remuneration components for the 2015 and 2016 financial years.
